In the 3rd episode of Does Not Compute, Sean and Paul discuss being just plain worn out, and how burnout is a real thing that happens to everyone, and what to do if it's happening to you. They also talk about how you don't need to know everything to be a good programmer, and how it's important to get to you the tools that you use instead of switching to every new fad.
