### Things Mentioned

This week we don't have many links for you, but we feel the content within the linked article below deserves some real thought. It's ok to feel tired or feel like you can't keep up with the pace of the JS community - The important thing is that you keep moving in at least some capacity. Pick what you're most interested in and dive deep. You'll find more success (and fun!) there than if you spread yourself too thin.
