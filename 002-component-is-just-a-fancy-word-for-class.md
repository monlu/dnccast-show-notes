In the second episode of Does Not Compute, Sean and Paul discuss different options for managing image assets within a Rails app, Sean's favorite new way to package a rails app for deploying to production, and how you might not even need to build a Single Page Application with all of those fancy (and expensive) new tools.

## Explanations
**What in the world is a Single Page App?**
> Single-Page Applications (SPAs) are Web apps that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app. SPAs use AJAX and HTML5 to create fluid and responsive Web apps, without constant page reloads. However, this means much of the work happens on the client side, in JavaScript.

**What are Web Components**

> Web Components are a set of standards currently being produced by Google engineers as a W3C specification that allow for the creation of reusable widgets or components in web documents and web applications. The intention behind them is to bring component-based software engineering to the World Wide Web.
